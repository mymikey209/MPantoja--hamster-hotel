Peer Review: From what I can see, this is a good start it just needs a bit of work. You have all the components built out you just need to do some moving around and optimize for responsiveness. The hero image text box needs to be moved up, everything can be aligned to the middle so when you scale down it isnt all to the left, the images in the packages section could be set to max-height max-width so they are still responsive. The images in the packages are pushing everything left so its creating a problem, but everything below that looks fine except for the reserve a room image, try and make it stay the same size as the box above it maybe try setting it to max or min height instead of locking it in place. Other than that alot is built out now you just need to refine it. Good job.
